My name is David Ndung'u. I was born and raised in Kenya and moved to the United States in 2024 to pursue my Master’s in Applied Data Science. Besides my fiancée, my greatest passion is knowledge. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Nairobi, and I later worked as a Software Development Engineer in Test at Safaricom PLC, one of Africa’s largest telcos.  

Driven by curiosity and ambition, I transitioned into Data Science and Machine Learning. I am currently completing my M.S. in Applied Data Science at Indiana University, Indianapolis (expected Dec 2025).  

Like Thomas Henry Huxley said: “Know something about everything, and everything about something.” Right now, my goal is to know everything about Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.  

As an international student, I am seeking opportunities on OPT status to apply my skills in solving impactful, real-world problems.
